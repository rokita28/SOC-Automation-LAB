# 🚀 SOC Automation Project – Homelab  

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Security Operations Center (SOC) Automation Homelab**, designed to enhance cybersecurity monitoring, alerting, and incident response capabilities. It integrates **open-source security tools** to simulate real-world **SOC workflows**, enabling automated threat detection, log analysis, and efficient security operations.

The homelab is built around a **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** solution, **Threat Intelligence**, and **Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR)** capabilities.

## 🏗️ Project Scope & Objectives
### **🔍 Key Focus Areas**
- **Threat Detection & Log Analysis:** Centralized log collection and security monitoring
- **SOC Automation (SOAR):** Automating response workflows to security incidents
- **Incident Management:** Efficient case tracking and investigation using SOC tools
- **Threat Intelligence:** Mapping alerts to **MITRE ATT&CK framework**
- **Integration of SIEM & SOAR:** Streamlining alert triage and threat hunting

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies Used
This project leverages a combination of **security tools** to provide **end-to-end automation** in SOC workflows:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Wazuh (SIEM)** | Log collection, monitoring, and threat detection |
| **TheHive (Incident Response Platform)** | Centralized case management for security events |
| **MITRE ATT&CK** | Threat mapping for adversary tactics & techniques |
| **Shuffle (SOAR Platform)** | Automating SOC workflows & response actions |
| **Elasticsearch + Kibana** | Data visualization & security dashboarding |
| **Sysmon (Windows Event Logging)** | Capturing system activities & suspicious behaviors |
| **Mimikatz (Red Team Testing)** | Simulated credential attacks for SOC validation |

---

## 🔄 Project Workflow
1. **Security Log Collection**  
   - Windows telemetry logs collected via **Sysmon**  
   - Logs forwarded to **Wazuh (SIEM)** for analysis  

2. **Threat Detection & Analysis**  
   - Correlation with **MITRE ATT&CK** framework  
   - Detection of security incidents, suspicious activities, and potential threats  

3. **Automated Incident Response (SOAR)**  
   - Alerts forwarded to **TheHive** for case management  
   - **Shuffle SOAR** triggers automated responses based on pre-defined rules  

4. **Visualization & Reporting**  
   - Data analyzed in **Elasticsearch/Kibana**  
   - Security dashboards created for real-time monitoring
